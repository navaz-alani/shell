`shell`

This is a simple shell application written in pure C. It is an attempt to
understand the Linux Programming Iterface. Currently, the shell can perform
basic execution of commands with arguments (such as `ls`, `cat <path_to_file>`).
Globbing has not been implemented, so commands such as `ls *.c` do not work as
expected.
